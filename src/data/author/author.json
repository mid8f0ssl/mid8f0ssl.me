  "summary": "Hi there! I'm a software engineer (since 2008) who is interested in web development, high-load systems, data analysis, and a lot of other cool things, IT and open-source enthusiast. Today I’m focusing on Python and Golang development as a platform engineer, focusing on AWS tech stack and serverless solutions. On the other side, I'm looking for new great stuff from the JavaScript world(ReactJS, NodeJs, GatsbyJS, etc). Generally, I was starting my “professional” life as a dude that created HTML templates with tables and images. But today, I'm a dedicated solution engineer, platform architect, and product technical leader on our teams.",
